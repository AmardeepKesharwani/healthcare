## Google AMP

### What is AMP?
AMP is a simple and robust format to ensure your website is fast, user-first, and makes money. AMP provides long-term success for your web strategy with distribution across popular platforms and reduced operating and development costs.

### Create great web experiences for users across the open web
AMP enables the creation of websites and ads that are consistently fast, beautiful and high-performing across devices and distribution platforms. Publishers and advertisers can decide how to present their content that emphasizes a user-first experience.

### Built-in components
⋅⋅* AMP HTML is HTML with some restrictions for reliable performance.

⋅⋅* Though most tags in an AMP HTML page are regular HTML tags, some HTML tags are replaced with AMP-specific tags (see also HTML Tags in the AMP spec). These custom elements, called AMP HTML components, make common patterns easy to implement in a performant way.

⋅⋅* For example, the amp-img tag provides full srcset support even in browsers that don’t support it yet. Learn how to create your first AMP HTML page.

⋅⋅* AMP pages are discovered by search engines and other platforms through the HTML tag. You can choose to have a non-AMP version and an AMP version of your page, or just an AMP version.
